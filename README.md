Software engineer with experience using PostgreSQL, Node, Express, React to build web apps. Background in management of restaurants, and project coordination. I'm not afraid to ask "why" or "is this the best way", and I thrive when I can understand the end goal while diving into the details.

I'm internally motivated and always eager to improve: learned to code through Udemy, Thinkful. My management and industry experience means I understand business decisions and organizations. My journey into coding means I'm ready to dive right into new skills and learn as I go!
